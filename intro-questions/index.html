			Griffin's Intro Questions
		</h1>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li> Griffin - <i> Junior -  Communication Design/Psychology </i> </li>
				<li> I'm from Seattle, Washington. Although this is a required class for me, I'm interested in learning about how to create my own website. </li>
				<li> I took CS131 but that was with Java </li>
				<li> I hope to get to a point with coding where I can apply design to my code to make it look good. </li>
				<li> I think there's a certain level of coding proficiency that we have to get to before we can apply design principles which is slightly different. </li>
				<li> <b> <a href="http://turnstyle.studio/" target="_blank"> Turnstyle </a> </b> -  I think Turnstyle has a really unique approach to a studio website. It's very easy to navigate but has a really interesting way of using minimalist design in a way that isn't boring.  </li>
				<li> <b> <a href="https://www.soccerbible.com/" target="_blank"> SoccerBible </a> </b> - SoccerBible has a very simple approach to showing their content. Most of the information that viewers want is on the first page and is very easy to access. </li>
				<li> <b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank"> Youtube </a> </b> - A classic but I don't think I've ever had trouble using youtube </li>
