				<li> Griffin - <i> Junior -  Communication Design/Psychology </i> </li>
				<li> I'm from Seattle, Washington. Although this is a required class for me, I'm interested in learning about how to create my own website. </li>
				<li> I took CS131 but that was with Java </li>
				<li> I hope to get to a point with coding where I can apply design to my code to make it look good. </li>
				<li> I think there's a certain level of coding proficiency that we have to get to before we can apply design principles which is slightly different. </li>
				<li> <i> turnstyle.studio </i> -  I think Turnstyle has a really unique approach to a studio website. It's very easy to navigate but has a really interesting way of using minimalist design in a way that isn't boring.  </li>
				<li> <i> soccerbible.com </i> - SoccerBible has a very simple approach to showing their content. Most of the information that viewers want is on the first page and is very easy to access. </li>
				<li> <i> youtube.com </i>  - A classic but I don't think I've ever had trouble using youtube </li>
