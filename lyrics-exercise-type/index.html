		<p class="subhead"> [Refrain] </p>
		<p class="lyrics"> 
			You ain't never think about nobody but yourself <br>
			Selfish <br> 
			Man, I really can't wait until you gon' need my help <br> 
			Helpless <br> You ain't never think about nobody but yourself <br> 
			Selfish <br>

		<p class="subhead"> [Chorus] </p>
		<p class="chorus"> 
			You must be the only child because you're so stingy <br> 
			I just wanna go buck wild when you don't defend me <br> 
			I been on the fuckin' prowl, I been countin' Benjis <br> 
			You done turned my heart so cold, I should work at Friendly's <br> 
			(Ain't shit sweet) <br> 
			Darlin', darlin', I've been prayin' for you, for you <br> 
			(I been prayin' for ya, I been prayin' for ya) For you <br> 
			(I been prayin', I been, I been, I been prayin' for you) <br> 
			Darlin', darlin', I've been callin' on God for you (Hope that He pick up) <br> 
			No, for you (Jesus Christ, pick up) <br> 
			(I'm hopin' that he pick up)
		</p>

		<p class="subhead"> [Verse 1] </p>
		<p class="lyrics"> 
			It's not your fault, it's how you were raised <br>
			Excuses, excuses really all that you say <br>
			Not here to play, you can't seem to share <br>
			Every other day, you forget how to care <br>
			About me, about me <br>
			What about me? About me? <br>
			Forgot me, what about me? <br>
			Used to be like P.B. (Help me, please)

		<p class="subhead"> [Verse 2] </p>
		<p class="lyrics"> 
			Every move you make, man, I swear it seem suspicious <br> 
			Lyin' through your teeth, so I don't rush to give you kisses <br> 
			Spiteful and malicious, hope that other chick got syphilis <br> 
			Sick of this, hard to stomach, now that nigga shittin' bricks <br> 
			Hypocrite, punch you in yo' lip, oh shit, you slippin', sis <br> 
			Used to arch my back for you and now I'm your arch-nemesis <br> 
			All men should be feminist, Donald Trump fucks immigrants <br> 
			I don't want to work it out, so cancel our gym membership <br> 
			I'ma leave this nigga, don't believe me, nigga? <br> 
			I was make-believin', nigga, it was only one season, nigga <br> 
			M.O.D., my nigga, money over dick <br> 
			Money over dick, you should stop breathin', nigga <br>
