		<h1>Feedback for Jefferson</h1>
		<ul>The first one does a great job of using the negative space to provide contrast for the text. The one piece of feedback I'd have is that it might be a bit of a challenge to transition the text from your desktop design to the mobile design.</ul>
		<ul>Also good positioning of the text on this one. The pattern on the background directly behind the text makes it a little hard to read "Burgerpants" because of how thin the typeface is so maybe think about using a slightly heavier weight.</ul>
		<ul>Pretty much the same feedback as the first one. Just keep in mind the challenge of transitioning the text between those two positions when scaling</ul>
